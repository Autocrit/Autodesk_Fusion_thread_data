Autodesk Fusion threads in XML format

## ISO bottom bracket threads

ISO 6696 defines metric threads that are (mostly) compatible with the BSA/BSC/etc 1.375" x 24 TPI standard

The 6H internal and 6g external thread dimensions were generated by [Theoretical Machinist's metric thread calculator](https://theoreticalmachinist.com/Threads-MetricMProfile.aspx) using a basic diameter of 34.925 mm and pitch of 1.058333333 mm, taking the median values for major diameter, pitch diameter and minor diameter.

Note: this is a first attempt at creating custom threads so use with caution.
